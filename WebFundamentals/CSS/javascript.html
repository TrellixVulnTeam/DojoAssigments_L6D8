            <h2 class="heads">JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[7] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[8] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

            As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

            <ul id ="newlist">
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>
                    <span>In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input. 
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Variable assignment</a>
                    <span>
                        In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

                        This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Data Types</a>
                    <span>
                        All types except objects define immutable values (values, which are incapable of being changed). For example and unlike to C, Strings are immutable. We refer to values of these types as "primitive values".
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a>
                    <span>
                        Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

                        Given that x = 5, the table below explains the comparison operators:
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li><a href="#">Loops</a>
                    <span>
                        Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

                        Often this is the case when working with arrays:

                    </span>
                </li>
                <li><a href="#">Functions</a>
                    <span>
                        A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

                        Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
                            
                        The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
                            (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
                            
                        The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

                    </span>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
